# DotNetCoreAPI-NextJS
A basic NextJS UI that connects to a ASP .NET Core API - used as a proof of concept for multicontainers/docker-compose on Azure

### Note: The environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_URL_API should be changed to the service(container name) that you're connecting to. If your API service in your Docker-Compose is named 'somecontainername', then change the variable or API endpoint to http://somecontainername:<port of your API>
